I'll put the resources I used there and maybe my extra notes, but when I learn this course, it's still ongoing so I put some materials in 2024 instead of 2025.

The materials in 2024 are copied from [Kettenkrado](https://github.com/Kettenkrado/UCB-CS70). Thank him for his share!

I recommend this path to study：Chose Week -> note(n) -> discussion(dis) -> discussion solution(dis-sol) -> homework(hw) -> homework solution(hw-sol)

- Note 0,1：Introduction, Propositional Logic
- Note 2：Proofs
- Note 3：Induction
